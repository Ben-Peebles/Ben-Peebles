Indicators of Malware include, but are not limited to unusual network traffic, large bits of data being transferred on ports they may or may not be normally closed. Ports being open or rules changed within a system. Large numbers of request for a certain file, users privileges being elevated without need.
 The behavior of a system after being infected with malware gives forensics clues into the type of malware.  Further digital forensics could help determine where the malware came from, how it got on the system, who made it, etc. 
The first thing an analyst would do is detect the system by looking for the indicators through the logs, network system, or processes module. If something is out of place they would move to the next process which is discovering the issue. When they discover exactly what is causing the problem they would have to isolate the issue. Get it off the network or out of the system that it is in. To do this they could use several methods including scanning the network for ports that shouldn’t be open and closing them. Looking for files that shouldn’t be on the system and deleting them. Ensuring the protective measures sat in place by your company are still in place. One the threat has been resolved they need to ensure that it doesn’t happen again by protecting the vulnerability that was penetrated. Once the new protective measures are put into place they need to be tested and reported.
